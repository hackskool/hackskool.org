## Helping our customers 🙋‍♀️

We’re doing everything we can to support our customers.


As a cloud based company, we’re well equipped to keep delivering on our goal to become the world’s best financial super app without disruption. Our support teams continue to provide a 24/7 service to our customers. From London to Melbourne to New York and Tokyo, all our teams are focussed on building more and better products for our customers.


## Helping our business customers 👨‍💼
The entire Revolut Business team are continuing to do all they can to support sole traders and businesses throughout this difficult period.


We have a dedicated blog hub which details all the information and initiatives set out by the UK Government to aid businesses and the self-employed, whilst continuing to keep our customers up-to-date with clear and concise information on all options available to them.


## Working with government 👩‍⚖️

Governments all over the world are playing an important role in providing information and support to those in need. We’re helping decision makers better understand the economic impact of the virus and how we can help our customers and businesses get back on their feet sooner.


We are lobbying the government to enable real time government payments into a Revolut account so our customers can access the support they need immediately.


With many freelancers and small businesses using Revolut Business, we’re also directly providing their feedback to government on the support they need and how it can best be accessed in a timely manner.


## Helping those in need 👩‍⚕️

The past few months have been difficult for many, especially those who have lost loved ones. We know that this time has also been hard for those experiencing a reduction in, or complete loss of income.


To help those who need it most, we’re enabling our customers to donate directly to a variety of charities including Medicin Sans Frontiers, The Red Cross  and  The Trussell Trust with their spare change or through a one off or recurring donation.

## Looking after our employees 👨‍💻

Protecting our employees around the world is always a priority for Revolut. We quickly closed offices around the world based on local guidance and shipped out all kinds of tech equipment within days. We communicate our strategies and risk levels regularly, ensuring that our people are as informed as we are, to ease anxiety and uncertainty.


As we navigate this new working model, we’re providing mental health support and resources and letting off some steam with virtual coffee mornings and team drinks.


Revolut’s core values guide us throughout this response. Our business reputation is built on thinking deeper to solve a problem, never settling for the status quo, getting it done, and above all, being stronger together. We owe it to our staff all around the world to do all we can to safeguard them, especially in extraordinary circumstances like these. We’re continuing to monitor the situation for staff as it unfolds.
